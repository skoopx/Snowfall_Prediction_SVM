# Snowfall_Prediction_SVM
This project is about multi-class Support Vector Machines and their applications. Using Multi-class SVM to predict the snowfall from the obtained data sets. Snowfall prediction
has been used in various fields such as Air traffic control, Weather forecasting, Transportation and Traffic Management, Agriculture, etc. The Snowfall of a particular region can be
calculated using various parameters such as Precipitation, Minimum Temperature, Maximum Temperature, Wind Speed, and
Wind Gust. Various researchers have proposed several methods for predicting Snowfall. This paper introduces an innovative approach for classifying types of Snowfall by employing a
Multi-class SVM model trained from collected datasets. We demonstrate our methodology by utilizing a dataset from github, comprising approximately 400 records. The sample is selected
to reduce the complexity and to increase the performance. The dataset is split into trained and testing data of 70% and 30%, respectively. Partitioned data like this helps us check how well the
model works and if it can be used for different situations. Given the parameters as the input such as Precipitation, Minimum Temperature, Maximum Temperature, and Wind Speed. 
The proposed model could predict the Types of Snowfall with a sensible accuracy of 83%. To improve the accuracy we have used the Hyperparameter Tuning method. 
Hyperparameter tuning is the practice of seeking the most effective configuration for a machine-learning model. Methods such as grid search are employed for this purpose. 
Through this process, our model has achieved an impressive accuracy of 91% in predicting different types of snowfall. As soft measurement technology advances, the
older instrument-based methods start to seem outdated and it is too expensive than that. By this method, the snowfall types are deduced by data analysis instead of weather instruments.
